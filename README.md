Reel Good Reviews
Reel Movie Reviews is a popular movie review site that has hired your design company to help improve some of its mobile pages. They have noticed that they are not having users stay on the pages for individual movie reviews very long, and are often not clicking on any of the links to see more content that is present on the pages.

The movie review page for Get Out is shown to the right. Look through the page and determine how we can improve readability and navigation on this page by improving the text design.

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced developer work through it, click “Get Unstuck“ to see a project walkthrough video.
